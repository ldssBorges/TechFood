# TechFood

TechFood is a FIAP Post-Graduation project that aims to create a web application for a food delivery service. The project is developed using the dotnet core framework and utilizes the ASP.NET Core MVC architecture. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, providing a seamless experience for both customers and restaurant owner. The project is built with a focus on clean architecture, DDD, and hexagonal architecture principles.

## Architecture (k8s)

### Solution Architecture

The TechFood application follows a microservices architecture designed to handle the specific business requirements of a food delivery service. The architecture addresses both business needs and infrastructure requirements for scalable deployment.

![Architecture Diagram](docs/k8s.png)

#### Business Requirements Addressed

The architecture solves the following business problems:

1. **Customer Self-Service Ordering**: Enables customers to browse menus and place orders independently without staff assistance
2. **Real-time Order Management**: Provides restaurant staff with immediate visibility into incoming orders and preparation status
3. **Payment Processing Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Mercado Pago for secure payment processing
4. **Order Tracking**: Allows customers to monitor their order status in real-time
5. **Multi-tenant Restaurant Support**: Supports multiple restaurants with isolated data and operations

#### Infrastructure Requirements

The solution is designed to run on various Kubernetes platforms:

- **Local Development**: Minikube or Kind for local testing and development
- **Cloud Platforms**:
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  - Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
  - Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Can be deployed on any Kubernetes-compliant platform

**Key Infrastructure Components**:

- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management
- **Load Balancing**: NGINX ingress controller for traffic distribution
- **Data Persistence**: SQL Server with persistent volume claims
- **Service Mesh**: Internal service communication via Kubernetes services
- **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and readiness probes
- **Scalability**: Horizontal pod autoscaling capabilities

### Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

#### Core Applications

- **SQL Server**: Database that stores all application data (users, restaurants, menus, orders)
- **API**: Backend API built with ASP.NET Core that handles all business logic
- **Self-Order**: Consumer-facing frontend for placing orders (RadixUI + React)
- **Monitor**: Real-time order tracking application for customers
- **Admin**: Restaurant management interface for menu and order management
- **NGINX**: Reverse proxy server for routing requests

#### Deployment & Infrastructure

## Order Flow - Swagger

After starting the application, all the endpoints can be tested using Swagger, which is available at the following URL: [http://localhost:5000/api/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:5000/api/swagger/index.html).

**Creating a new order**:

Do a post to endpoint `/v1/orders`:

![Create Order Flow](/docs/backend/create-order-endpoint.png)

Obs: to get the `productId`, you can use the endpoint `/v1/products` to list all products. if there is no products, follow the step - **Admin Flow - Swagger**

**Creating a new payment**:

After creating an order, you can create a new payment by doing a post to endpoint `/v1/payments`:

![Create Payment Flow](/docs/backend/create-payment-endpoint.png)

You should get as response the QR code to be scanned by the consumer to complete the payment.

![Create Payment Flow](/docs/backend/create-payment-endpoint-response.png)

After the payment a weebhook will be called to update the order status to PAID and the preparation status to PENDING.

Obs: The weebhook is not implemented yet so you can call directly the endpoint `/v1/payments/{paymentId}`

**Changing preparation status**:

To change the preparation status, you can do a PATCH to the following endpoints:

![Change Preparation Status Flow](/docs/backend/change-preparation-status-endpoint.png)

- `/v1/preparations/{preparationId}/start` to change the status to INPROGRESS.
- `/v1/preparations/{preparationId}/finish` to change the status to DONE.
- `/v1/preparations/{preparationId}/cancel` to change the status to CANCELLED.

After changing the preparation status to DONE you can finish the order and preparation flow doing a PATCH to the endpoint `/v1/orders/{orderId}/finish`.

## Admin Flow - Swagger

In order to create a new product, first you need to create a catergory by doing a post to endpoint `/v1/categories`:

![Create Product Flow](/docs/backend/create-category-endpoint.png)

Then, you can create a new product by doing a post to endpoint `/v1/products`:

![Create Product Flow](/docs/backend/create-product-endpoint.png)

## Order Flow - Frontend

1. **Consumer**: The consumer uses the self-order application to browse the menu, select items, and place an order. The order is then sent to the restaurant for preparation:

![Consumer Order Flow](/docs/self-order/start.png)
![Consumer Order Flow](/docs/self-order/menu.png)
![Consumer Order Flow](/docs/self-order/finish.png)

2. **Restaurant**: The restaurant receives the order through the admin panel, where they can manage the menu and track order preparation and delivery:
